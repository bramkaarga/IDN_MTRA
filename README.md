# IDN_MTRA
Multihazard Transport Risk Analysis for road transport in Indonesia

Attempts to adopt the approach presented in Koks et al., 2019, specifically for an Indonesia context. Some codes and functions used are adopted and adapted from the paper's Github repository (https://github.com/ElcoK/gmtra).

- 01_data_preprocess.ipynb provides scripts needed to process raw data from OpenStreetMap and Risk Data Platform (https://risk.preventionweb.net/)
- 02_risks_calculation.ipynb provides scripts for superimposing natural hazard maps with the road network.
- 03_vulnerability_classification.ipynb provides scripts for (i) aggregating road assets risks at a provincial level, (ii) classifying provinces based on their vulnerability (1 is the most vulnerable category while 4 is the least vulnerable category). 


Corresponding data for the Indonesia context to run the scripts can be made available upon contact with the author (bramkaarga@gmail.com).
